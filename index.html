            <h4>CityU Canteen Reviews</h4>
            <p class="intro-canteen">As a student at CityU, the canteens are not just a place to eat, but also a crucial part of campus life. Here are my reviews of AC1, AC2, and AC3 based on my experiences!</p>
            <div class="canteen">
                <h5>AC1 Canteen⭐⭐⭐⭐</h5>
                <p class="location">📍 Located at Yeung Kin Man Academic Building</p>
                <p>AC1 is the largest and most popular canteen on campus. Be prepared for a crowd — finding a seat during peak lunch hour can be a real challenge! 🏃‍♂️💨</p>
                <p class="dish">🍜 Must-try dish: Rice Noodles in Sour Spicy Soup ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
                <p>I highly recommend adding the Spicy Sliced Pork with Bean Sauce. If you're a rice noodle lover, the flavor here is absolutely on point! 👌</p>
                <p class="price">💰 Price: Very budget-friendly! Much cheaper than eating outside. 👍</p>
            </div>
            <div class="canteen">
                <h5>AC2 Canteen⭐⭐⭐</h5>
                <p class="location">📍 Located at Li Dak Sum Yip Yio Chin Academic Building</p>
                <p>Although I haven't personally dined at AC2 Canteen yet, I've heard different reviews from many students. I'm planning to visit AC2 soon to form my own judgment. I'm curious to discover whether it truly lives up to its underwhelming reputation or it might offer some unexpectedly pleasant flavors.</p>   
                <p class="price">💰 Price: Affordable. The menu seems to be reasonably priced, making it accessible for students on a budget.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="canteen">
                <h5>AC3 Canteen⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</h5>
                <p class="location">📍 Located at Lau Ming Wai Academic Building</p>
                <p>AC3 operates on a self-selection system, allowing you to pick your favorite dishes all at once. This format is perfect for my preference for spicy food, as AC3 offers a variety of spicy options such as stir-fried Yellow Beef and Signature Three-Cup Chicken.</p>
                <p class="price">💰 Price: Slightly higher. But the food quality is perfect.</p>
